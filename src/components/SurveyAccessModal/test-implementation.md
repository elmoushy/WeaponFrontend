# Groups Survey Sharing Implementation

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Backend API Support
- Updated `SurveyVisibility` type to include `'GROUPS'`
- Added `AdminGroup` and `AdminGroupsResponse` types
- Added `getMyAdminGroups()` method to `surveyService.ts`
- Updated `updateSurveyAccess()` to handle `'groups'` access level

### 2. Frontend UI Components
- Added GROUPS access option to SurveyAccessModal
- Implemented group selection UI with:
  - Groups count display
  - Scrollable groups list
  - Checkbox selection for groups
  - Loading and empty states
- Added comprehensive translations for both Arabic and English

### 3. Component Logic
- Added state management for:
  - `availableGroups` - list of admin groups from API
  - `selectedGroups` - user-selected groups
  - `isLoadingGroups` - loading state
- Implemented group management functions:
  - `loadAdminGroups()` - fetches groups from API
  - `isGroupSelected()` - checks if group is selected
  - `toggleGroupSelection()` - handles group selection/deselection
- Updated save logic to handle GROUPS visibility

### 4. CSS Styling
- Added comprehensive styles for groups section
- Includes hover effects, selection states
- Night theme support
- Consistent with existing UI patterns

## API Endpoints Used

### GET /api/surveys/my-admin-groups/
- Fetches groups where user is administrator
- Returns groups with admin_level information
- Used in `loadAdminGroups()` method

### PATCH /api/surveys/surveys/{id}/
- Updates survey with GROUPS visibility
- Uses existing `updateSurveyAccess()` method
- Handles the new 'groups' access level

## How It Works

1. User selects GROUPS visibility option
2. Component automatically loads admin groups via API
3. User can select/deselect groups from the list
4. Save button updates survey visibility to GROUPS
5. Selected groups are passed to parent component

## Technical Details

- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Reactive state management with Vue 3 Composition API
- CSS modules for scoped styling
- Comprehensive error handling
- Loading states and empty states
- Internationalization support (Arabic/English)

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. The component will:
- Show GROUPS option when user has admin groups
- Allow selection of multiple groups
- Save the visibility setting to backend
- Provide proper user feedback during operations
